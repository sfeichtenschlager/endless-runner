# Endless Runner
[Visit the GitHub repo](https://github.com/sfeichtenschlager/endless-runner/)


## Project Files
To reduce the size of the Unity project files in the repository, only Assets, Packages and ProjectSettings have been added. Any needed files should be there.

## Working instructions
You'll have to work in the Windows Command Line.<br><br>
First, clone the repository into a folder using `git clone https://github.com/sfeichtenschlager/endless-runner/`.<br>
When finished editing the project, use `git add .` to add all files. Then use `git commit -m "Input here what you did"` to commit the files and add information about the edit.<br>
At last, use `git push` to save the changes.<br><br>
Use `git pull` before editing the files again to get the newest version.
